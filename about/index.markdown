### What is this all about?
So. We're Fast Familiar - a group of recovering theatre makers and artists from different creative and academic backgrounds.

We design ‘audience-centric’ experiences. That means that you, the audience, are at the heart of it all.

Sometimes you’re making decisions. Sometimes you’re figuring things out.

Most of the time you’re making sense of the world with strangers.

**Our art is not just a picture to look at or a piece of theatre to watch.**

**It's a space for you to be alive in. A place where you can explore questions that are too complex for daily life.**


Life moves fast. We live in a state of (dis)information overload and the internet can push us into making oversimplified binary choices. Our artworks are a supported space to explore these things we all experience, but find difficult to discuss. They’re part artwork, part consensual social experiment. Fast Familiar are fascinated by social psychology and human connection in a rapidly changing world.

What we make is experimental and ambitious but you don't have to be an art expert or to have read a ton of books to enjoy it. Our experiences take you to a part of your brain that embraces complexity - they're an invitation to operate at the top of your intelligence and curiosity.

We work with digital technology a lot - which we think of as a kind of magic cloak of invisibility. We use it to get out of the way so that you as an audience member can have more meaningful interactions with other people.

It's not about shiny tech though. It’s about connection and co-creating with you - our audience.

We've been around since 2008 and in a past life, Fast Familiar made work under the name fanSHEN - it’s used in various reviews and articles. You can see the work we made under that name, and the reason we changed it [here](https://www.fanshen.org.uk/).
