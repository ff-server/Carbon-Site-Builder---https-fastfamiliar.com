highlighted-artwork-description:
    - The Acquisitions Panel is an audience-centric experience about the legacies of European colonialism and who gets to choose the stories we tell about the past.
    - Looking for Love is a playful interactive artwork for humans, inviting you to take the perspective of another form of intelligence to reflect on the peculiarities of our own.
    - Do What You Must is an immersive scenario-based tool to model better decision-making in the face of the impending risks and uncertainty of climate change.
    - Social Sandwich is a project about online encounters with strangers - and the potential for connection rather than conflict. Instead of doom-scrolling during your lunchbreak, talk to someone in another country, see the world from their perspective, and make sense of the world together.
    - The Justice Syndicate is an interactive medium drawing on a jury format. It explores how taken-for-granted assumptions, intuitions and emotions influence decision-making.
    - The Window is an immersive audio experience blending story, music and spatial sound. Spanning three generations and 40 years, it asks what we inherit from the past and what control we have over the future.
    - Smoking Gun is a whistleblower thriller for remote audiences. Mixing game, digital art and social experiment, it asks how we can use digital clues to hold the people in power to account.
    - There’s been a murder. The police have a suspect but the evidence doesn’t paint a clear picture. Watch the testimonies, scrutinise the evidence, discuss with your fellow jurors – and reach your verdict.
    - Part story, part immersive audio experience and part walk, A Walk in the Park is a 30 minute illumination of the games we play in public spaces, and the different rules that apply, depending on who you are.

highlighted-artwork-awards:
    - The Acquisitions Panel received the Alternate Realities Award Jury Special Mention, at Sheffield DocFest 2022, and the Activist Museum Award.
    - Can you teach a robot how to love? Play Looking for Love and find out. Coming soon... premiere in AI - Who’s Looking After Me? at Science Gallery London, 21 June 2023 – 20 January 2024.
    - Do What You Must is a unique opportunity to rehearse adaptation and resilience in the face of climate risk and was selected for the Green Zone programme at COP26.
    - Social Sandwich is part of MediaFutures - this project has received funding from the European Union’s framework Horizon 2020 for research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 951962.
    - The Justice Syndicate was selected for Aesthetica Art Prize Anthology - Future Now - 100 contemporary artists of 2020; and longlisted for the Lumen Prize.
    - The Window is the recipient of one of Alzheimer’s Research UK’s inaugural Inspire Awards and a collaboration with the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing.
    - Smoking Gun was featured by the Financial Times as one of 'Top ten dramas to enjoy at home’ (May 2020), and selected for the Centre for Investigate Journalism’s Logan Symposium.
    - The Evidence Chamber was featured by the New York Times as ‘an especially successful way for theater to be enjoyed from a laptop’ after a sold-out three week lockdown run played by international audiences.
    - A Walk in the Park was commissioned by Tender Abscence for their 2021 international online festival.

Fast Familiar make artworks that are participatory, playful and political. 
You, the audience, are at the heart of what is happening - making decisions, solving problems, working together in different ways. Our experiences are often described as ‘interactive’ or ‘immersive’.

You'll often use a computer, tablet device or smartphone to access our artworks. We’re committed to making this process as easy to navigate as possible. You get clear instructions and there is always someone on hand to help. We use digital technology to enable new forms of human connection. It's there to allow you to communicate and collaborate with other audience members.

As well as the artworks featured below, we also have a strand of work that we call '[FF for Fun](https://fastfamiliar.com/for-fun/)'.
