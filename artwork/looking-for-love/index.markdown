# Looking for Love

_What’s the most efficient way to fall in love?_

_What would happen if you let data determine the biggest decisions of your life?_

_Surely training a machine on everything the internet knows about love will result in unparalleled romantic success?_

Can you teach a robot how to love? Looking for Love is a playful interactive artwork for humans. Part modern-day tamagotchi, part interactive fiction, part experiment, the experience happens over three days (or less if you’re impatient) via a message-based chat app. 

Artificial Intelligence, human intuition and everything that gets lost in translation, this artwork invites you to take the perspective of another form of intelligence to reflect on the peculiarities of our own.

Looking for Love is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.
