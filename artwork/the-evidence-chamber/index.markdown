# The Evidence Chamber

_There’s been a murder. The police have a suspect but the evidence doesn’t paint a clear picture. In an online jury deliberation room, you watch the testimonies, scrutinise the evidence, discuss with your fellow jurors – and reach your verdict._

_The decision you make will change someone’s life: what will you choose?_

If you’re a fan of crime fiction or true crime, this is the show for you. The Evidence Chamber is made in collaboration with forensic scientists at the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, and is the second courtroom show from the team behind The Justice Syndicate.

_Content warning: The Evidence Chamber contains strong language and a reference to domestic violence._

The Evidence Chamber is commissioned by the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee.

> "The 2020 theatre awards ceremonies have largely been cancelled ... But, if prizes are given for lockdown drama, Fast Familiar should get a trophy for The Evidence Chamber and Smoking Gun – enjoyable but also scholarly entertainments. This is a company to watch, whether digitally or, when it again becomes possible, in person."
