# National Elf Service

National Elf Service is a puzzle game for anyone who feels low low low on the 'ho ho ho'.

2020\. A Christmas like no other. Festive spirit is at an all time low. The toy factory has ground to a halt, the sleigh’s gathering dust in the garage, and everyone’s looking glum. Can you help Holly and the other elves save the day?

Escape reality to a winter wonderland which needs your puzzle-solving, code-cracking skills. Join the Elite Elf Force -Merry, Berry and Sherry- on a mission to make this the most wonderful time of the year.

National Elf Service is a cross between a puzzle game, an online escape room, and an interactive audio book. Whether your team is in the same room or playing together online, there’s room on the sleigh for everyone (teams of up to 6, suitable for age 8+ playing with adults).
