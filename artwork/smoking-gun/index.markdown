# Smoking Gun

_A whistleblower contacts you, says they have information which the public should see. But they need your help getting it out there._

_Over 6 days, you receive information on your phone - you solve puzzles and put clues together to figure out what is going on. You message with a small group of other people who are playing - you compare theories and work together. At the end of the week your group will have to decide whether you go to the newspapers with what you’ve found out._

_As you’re drawn into a world of politics, corruption and surveillance, who can you trust?_

Smoking Gun is a thriller for a remote audience in a world of disinformation.
