# Do What You Must

Do What You Must is a scenario-based tool to model better decision-making in the face of the impending risks and uncertainty of climate change. Drawing on neuroscience and social psychology, it uses immersive narrative and interactivity to equip participants with the tools for collaborative decision-making to arrive at a sustainable, scalable solutions. 

A small group of participants take on the role of an advisory board to a North American ski conglomerate. Carefully crafted video ‘testimonies’ draw the audience into the scenario, equipping them with knowledge about the company - which, like all winter leisure providers, is severely affected by our changing climate. The participants review information and make decisions to safeguard the future of their fictional company. The activity’s bespoke control system alters the trajectory of the scenario in real time, in response to participant decisions. In a world full of uncertainty and competing values, how will they know the right thing to do?

Do What You Must provides essential learnings on how groups work together, and in a debrief after the narrative part of the experience, participants reflect and extrapolate their experience of decision-making during the scenario to their own context.
