# A Walk in the Park

_So here we are. Just two people on a walk together. Me in the park and you - wherever you are._

_What can you see? What route do you choose? What traces do you leave?_

_What do you imagine when you look at other people?_

_And what do they see when they look at you? (Other than your radiant beauty and magnetic natural charm, of course.)_

Part story, part immersive audio experience and part walk, A Walk in the Park is a 30 minute illumination of the games we play in public spaces, and the different rules that apply, depending on who you are.

Please listen, wearing headphones, while taking a walk in a space -like a park- where you might go to relax. Do the walk during the day, when the space is busy. 

There are two versions of A Walk in the Park. The words, music and sound design are the same in both. In one version, ‘I’ is a woman. In the other version, ‘I’ is a man. You can choose which version to use, or listen to one and then the other.

_Content warning: A Walk in the Park contains references to male violence._
