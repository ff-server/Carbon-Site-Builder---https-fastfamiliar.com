# The Justice Syndicate

_A top surgeon accused of a serious crime. Conviction would mean planned operations will not go ahead – and the evidence is far from conclusive._

The Justice Syndicate is a piece of playable theatre drawing on a jury format. It explores how taken-for-granted assumptions, intuitions and emotions influence decision-making.

Power and privilege; trust and technology; thought and action.

How will you vote?

_Content warning: The Justice Syndicate contains both discussion of sexual assault and explicit description of consensual sexual activity._

The Justice Syndicate was selected for the Aesthetica Art Prize Anthology: Future Now (100 contemporary artists of 2020) and Lumen Prize (interactive art) longlist.

The Justice Syndicate is supported by Near Now, King's Cultural Institute and London South Bank University.
