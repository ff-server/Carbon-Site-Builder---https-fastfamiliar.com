highlighted-artwork-description:
    - When everyone is a suspect, and a killer is on the loose, is anybody safe?<br /><br />A mansion near Dundee, 1923. Susie Sato finds herself investigating a murder when her great-uncle and host Lord Hamilton is found dead in his private museum, an ancient Egyptian burial dagger protruding from his back. Could it be the curse of the dagger, an object Lord Hamilton was warned not to remove from the tomb? Or could something else have caused his death?
    - A puzzle game with a sense of humour, set aboard the world’s most underprepared airline. Help flight attendant Rhys as he wrangles over-demanding VIP passengers, escaped anxiety pets and his own luckless love life. Can you be his wingman? Work with your friends to solve puzzles, crack codes and avert death by discount airline.
    - National Elf Service is an interactive audio adventure puzzle game for anyone who feels low low low on the ‘ho ho ho’. Playable online with friends/ family you can’t meet up, it’s FF’s contribution to a merry 2020 Christmas.

Fast Familiar are known for making artworks that grapple with big political issues - disinformation, data and surveillance, ethical conundrums. But sometimes we want to make projects which are just.... well, fun. That’s not to say the other stuff isn’t fun and/ or rewarding, but with our ‘FF for Fun’ artworks you can:
- Play them at any time.
- Maybe still learn something about the world and yourself - but definitely have a laugh while you’re doing it.
- Still expect FF values - so you’ll see LGBTQ characters, characters from all different cultural and ethnic backgrounds and characters who subvert restrictive gender norms. 

For the record, FF firmly believe that it's totally possible to smash the patriarchy through terrible jokes and puzzle games.
