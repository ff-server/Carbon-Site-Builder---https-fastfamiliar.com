Fast Familiar have been engaging with ideas around climate action since the early 2010s. We see art as a space where people can imagine and rehearse different futures. 

Since 2016, we’ve worked in partnership with neuroscientist [Dr Kris De Meyer](https://www.krisdemeyer.com/) (UCL’s [Climate Action Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/climate-action-unit/)), who uses ‘brain insights’ from his work to foster an action-led approach to climate change. We apply these insights to our interactive artworks.

We have made a number of artworks which directly explore taking action in response to climate change. You can read about these below.

We use our [documentation blog](https://workroom.fastfamiliar.com/) to share our methodology for reducing the carbon footprint of our digital artworks. We also have a ‘how to’ guide, documenting how we radically reduced the carbon footprint (and simultaneously improved the accessibility) of this website.

As part of [The Networked Condition](https://thenetworkedcondition.com/), an ongoing project undertaken with [AND](https://www.andfestival.org.uk/) and [Arts Catalyst](https://www.artscatalyst.org/), we created a free-to-use tool for planning digital artworks. You can also read a series of interviews with leading artists in this field.

We’re part of the Julie’s Bicycle [International Touring and Environmental Responsibility](https://juliesbicycle.com/news/international-touring-and-environmental-responsibility-cohort-announcement/) programme, and are regularly asked to write and speak about our approach to climate action. Climate action underpins everything that we do, so feel free to [get in touch](https://fastfamiliar.com/contact-us/) if you’re planning an event.

## Featured projects

[The Strategy Room](/research/the-strategy-room) - an immersive experience which uses facilitated discussion and social psychology to find out what non-experts really think about climate change policies. Created with Nesta and UCL’s Climate Action Unit, it’s a way for someone to walk in off the street and within an hour, to imagine the benefits of a Net Zero future, and to have their say on how we get there. 

[Do What You Must](/artwork/do-what-you-must) - a scenario-based tool to facilitate training in group-based decision-making in the face of climate risk and uncertainty. Drawing on neuroscience and social psychology, it uses immersive narrative and interactivity to equip participants with the tools for collaborative decision-making to arrive at a sustainable, scalable solutions. It premiered in the Green Zone at COP26.

[If I Were You](/education/if-i-were-you) - an interactive digital YA story about friendship and trying to do the right thing in a fast-moving world. Co-created with teenagers, it explores the decisions we make about protest, citizenship and climate emergency. If I Were You was supported by Nesta and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.
