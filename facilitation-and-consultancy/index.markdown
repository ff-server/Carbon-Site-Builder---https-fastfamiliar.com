As well as creating discrete research and public engagement projects with partners, Fast Familiar also provide facilitation, teaching, consultancy and mentorship, usually around:
- making organisations more playful
- what a digital or interactive approach could look like
- doing things in a more environmentally-conscious way

Our approach is informed by the understanding of psychology and group dynamics that we’ve gained through years of making interactive work. We really enjoy coming up with the right structure to help a group collaborate creatively.

Here are a few examples of how we’ve worked in the past:

_when a group of people are trying out a new approach or project_

Rachel worked with National Trust property Sudbury Hall & the Museum of Childhood to imagine what a playful winter offer would be. The process involved facilitating sessions with the whole staff and volunteer team, developing ideas further with the team members leading the project and supporting the process of recruiting other creatives to deliver what became Game On!, an incredibly successful programme which saw Sudbury’s visitor numbers quadruple.


_when an artist is trying something different_

In the summer of 2020, Dan mentored artist Jana Wendler from Playfuel Games  as she developed a series of science public engagement games. Jana wanted support in challenging and adapting her creative process and thinking more deeply about the role of narrative in her work. Dan facilitated Jana to develop new ideation, user testing and iteration processes. Jana wrote: "I really enjoyed the mentoring sessions with Dan. I loved having a chance to reflect on my practice and to explore new approaches at a time when I felt  stuck in a rut. Dan gave me the space and tools to talk through my thoughts and issues as well as generously sharing his own experience. Our chats were a great way to stay connected to playful ideas and the wider community during what was a very isolating time for creative work.”


_when a higher education institution is diversifying its offer_

When, mid pandemic, London South Bank University’s Drama department realised that their normal ‘Company-in-residence’ module wouldn’t work via remote teaching, they asked Fast Familiar to develop a new module in digital theatre-making. Delme and Rachel worked with second year drama students to make an online show in a week. Students gained basic digital production skills and created three high quality shows which took autobiographical perspectives on the events of 2020. Students reported that the experience was challenging but enabled them to create something they were proud of - and that gave them confidence in their own abilities to adjust to changed industry conditions.
