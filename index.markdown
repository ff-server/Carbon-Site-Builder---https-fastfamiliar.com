# bullet point elements and explanations
bullets:
    - <strong>We live in a world of information overload.</strong><br />Life moves fast. Things are normalised so quickly that you don't always have time to stop & ask yourself "am I OK with this?".
    - <strong>Our future depends on collective action</strong><br />We already know that climate change & social injustice will never be solved by one person. So it's more important than ever to understand how groups make decisions. To tap into our collective intelligence.
    - <strong>What's audience-centric theatre got to do with it?</strong><br />Part theatre, part game, each Fast Familiar experience is a supported space for you to get beneath the surface of the stories we're told & make sense of the world with strangers.
    - <strong>You, the audience, are at the heart of what is happening.</strong><br />You’re supported by experts in story-telling, audience care & environmentally-conscious tech. 
    - <strong>Fast Familiar experiences give you new tools to explore human connection.</strong><br />So you can tap into human collective intelligence & connect with other people in meaningful ways.
