# The Strategy Room

### Project description

The Strategy Room is an immersive experience which uses facilitated discussion and social psychology to find out what non-experts really think about climate change policies. It’s a way for someone to walk in off the street and within 90 minutes, to imagine the benefits of a Net Zero future, and to have their say on how we get there.

We all know that climate change is a problem, but on our own, it’s hard to know what to do about it, especially when there are so many other things to worry about. We need to work together to come up with a plan. This isn’t about giving everything up - it’s about new technologies, smarter ways of living and a future where we could be happier. 

_Step into The Strategy Room. You’re here today to decide on a plan for a better future. You’ll discuss different options with your fellow participants and vote. Can you deliver a successful strategy for your local area?_

### Commissioning aims

The Strategy Room is commissioned by Nesta, and created in partnership with UCL’s Climate Action Unit. 

The experience was  developed with the input of residents and council staff from Lambeth, Sandwell and Southend-on-sea. The digital control system for the experience collects anonymised data on participant responses, which can be used to inform policy or communication strategies.

In the period January - March 2023, we delivered the pilot phase of The Strategy Room, reaching 639 participants in 66 sessions accross 12 local authorities.

The Strategy Room was shortlisted for the Business Green Awards 2023 in the Behaviour Change category. You can read more about the project on our process blog: the process of [creating a design brief](https://workroom.fastfamiliar.com/the-strategy-room-design-brief/); the project's [structure and delivery](https://workroom.fastfamiliar.com/the-strategy-room-delivery/); and [5 key lessons](https://workroom.fastfamiliar.com/the-strategy-room-5-lessons/) we learned during the project.
