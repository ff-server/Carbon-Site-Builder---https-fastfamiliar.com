# The Justice Syndicate

### Project description

In The Justice Syndicate, twelve players make up a jury who must review documents and audio and video evidence on iPads to reach a verdict on a case which implicitly explores gender, class and privilege.

Carefully crafted ‘testimonies’ draw the audience into the scenario while the bespoke control system uses machine learning to subtly differentiate each juror’s experience to generate deeper dialogue. It also logs anonymised data on each juror’s decision-making process. The piece gives players an embodied experience of group decision making and then allows them to step back and appreciate the cognitive processes underlying their conversations.

### Commissioning aims

The Justice Syndicate is supported by King's Cultural Institute and London South Bank University.

It is a collaboration with Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King's College London. Kris researches how minds change and how views become entrenched. Conceived in response to our increasingly polarised society, The Justice Syndicate is an interactive medium to explore how taken-for-granted assumptions, intuitions and emotions influence decision-making.

The piece also uses technology to take the level of interactivity and agency of audience members to a new level; in most previous “delegated art” the level of social interaction and meaningful agency has been fairly modest (Harvie, 2013). The Justice Syndicate’s synthesis of complex computational processes and social psychology into a transformative group experience pioneers a more audience-focussed future for digital art, in which new affordances can be used to activate diverse and polyphonic perspectives on contemporary societal fracture.
